## Work Introduction
### &emsp;&emsp;In this repositorie I will show you my learning process on embodied ai , and the folder being provided contains a compilation of my literature and a report on the reading .</br></br>


## What is Embodied AI ?
### &emsp;&emsp;Nowadays , there is now an emerging paradigm shift from the era of 'Internet AI' to the era of 'embodied AI'. That is, AI algorithms and agents no longer learn from datasets of images, videos or text primarily from the Internet, but through interaction with their environment i.e. similar to types of research such as artificial intelligence + robotics.</br></br>

- ### Internet AI(Disembodied AI)&nbsp;:&nbsp;learn from datasets of images, videos ortext curated primarily from the internet . </br></br>
- ### Embodied AI&nbsp;:&nbsp;learn through interactions with their environments from an egocentric perception similar to humans . </br></br>

### &emsp;&emsp;Based on this definition, the demand for embodied AI simulators to support a variety of embodied AI research tasks has grown significantly. And at this stage there are three main research tasks for embodied AI - visual exploration, visual navigation and embodied question answering (QA).
